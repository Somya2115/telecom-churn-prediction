# telecom-churn-prediction
Approach:

We have performed data preprocessing, Missing Value Analysis, Feature Engineering, identified most valuable customers, tagged churners, and performed required EDA. We have mentioned few inferences observed during EDA.

As part of data preparation, we have split the data into train-test dataset using train-test-split from sklearn. We have performed scaling before building our first model.

We have used Logistic Regression model on actual features and gained an accuracy of 80%
